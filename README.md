# Voice Visualizer

Voice Visualizer is a simple Python program that captures audio input from the microphone and visualizes it as a sine wave using Pygame.

## Features

- Real-time visualization of audio input as a sine wave.
- Adjustable threshold for detecting audio input.
- Responsive visualization based on the amplitude of the audio input.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame
- PyAudio

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/voice-visualizer.git
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install pygame
    pip install pyaudio
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the `voice_visualizer.py` script:

    ```bash
    python voice_visualizer.py
    ```

2. Adjust the threshold as needed to detect audio input.
3. Speak into the microphone and observe the real-time visualization on the screen.

## Configuration

You can adjust the following parameters in the `voice_visualizer.py` script:

- `screen_width` and `screen_height`: Width and height of the Pygame display window.
- `CHUNK`, `FORMAT`, `CHANNELS`, and `RATE`: Parameters for configuring the PyAudio stream.
- `threshold`: Adjust this value to set the minimum amplitude required to trigger visualization.
